.SH NAME
DArcomage \- Tower-building card game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B darcomage
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DArcomage
is a card game in which two players race to build their tower to the top, demolish the opponent's tower, or accumulate a lot of resources. That is done by playing cards that have different effects.

You can play either against an AI opponent or in a hotseat game. You play the card by clicking on it (the top card row belongs to the player to the right, the bottom row belongs to the left player), and discard by right-clicking on it.

is the SDL2 and OpenGL frontend to
.BR libarcomage ,

.SH OPTIONS
